- Investigated Topic: The study investigates terminal decline in well-being, focusing on the role of social orientation and engagement in this process.

- Research Question: The key question addressed is how social orientation (behavioral and motivational levels of social participation and valuing social and family goals) is associated with differences in terminal decline in well-being.

- Research Method: The approach involved applying single- and multiphase growth models to longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study. This data included up to 27-year annual observations from 2,910 deceased participants.

- Findings: The results revealed that leading a socially active life and prioritizing social goals in late life were independently associated with higher late-life well-being, less pronounced decline, and a later onset of terminal decline.

- Implications: The findings suggest that maintaining social orientation into late life may help mitigate terminal decline in well-being, highlighting the importance of social engagement and goal prioritization in the context of aging and end-of-life well-being.
